## My code was created from a bottom to top hierarchy. I did this because I want it to render first and not miscalculate previous expressions. 

## Issue: It's taking longer than expected because my logic for determining upper/lowercase required(thus, the original generated code being altered) is not completed. In lieu of this, the code currently points to the code determining a new password for special characters.
